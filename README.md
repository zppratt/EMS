# EMS

This is a basic EMS 911 system.

The principle of the system is simple: when a person reports an emergency, they call the EMS operator. The operator gathers the callerâ€™s information and evaluates the gravity of the emergency using the information displayed by the system. (S)he starts an emergency procedure, calling the necessary responders. Once the team is at the location of the emergency, the case can be closed. The system records the data concerning the intervention such as the response time, the contact information of the caller, the type of emergency and the teams requested. The primary operation of the system will be to record and store records representing emergency events entered by the dispatch/operator and store them for archival and potentially review purposes. The system also provides for an administrator to manage users and records.
